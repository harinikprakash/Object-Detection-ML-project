# Object-Detection-ML-project
ENHANCING THE ACCURACY IN OBJECT DETECTION WITH SPECIFIC CNN MODEL FINE TUNING
📌OVERVIEW

This project focuses on building a high-accuracy object detection model using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model classifies images into two categories — "Cow" and "Patel" — using minimal training data, making it suitable for low-resolution and real-time image scenarios.

⚙️FEATURES

Custom CNN with input, 3 hidden, and output layers

Lightweight model trained on limited images

High performance on real-time and low-res inputs

Binary classification with TensorFlow and Keras

🛠️TOOLS AND TECH

Python, TensorFlow, Keras

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📚ML HIGHLIGHTS

CNN-based object detection

Fine-tuned architecture with tailored activation functions and optimizers

Efficient training and accurate predictions in resource-constrained environments
